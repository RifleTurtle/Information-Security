## A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration

 Security misconfiguration is a common issue and can cause critical vulnerabilities 

Vulnerabilities may my present when:

	Software is out of date
	Unnecessary features are still active
	Error messages are overly informative to users

## A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components

-Applications that are used should always be robust, reliable, and updated.
Outdated and vulnerable components easily create openings for attackers to get into and tamper with systems

Vulnerabilities may my present when:
	
	Little is understood and known about the systems and components utilized
	Components are obtained from an unreliable source
	Not up-to-date with security warnings and notices regarding utilized components

To improve and maintain security

	Unused and outdated components should be removed
	Components should be frequently monitored and scanned for updates and 	vulenerabilities

## A03:2021 – Injection

Injections refer to external users (attackers) inserting their own text, data, or code into an application to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or lateral privileges 

Application can be attacked when:
	
	User input is not sanitized and verified automatically
	Attackers data/input is inserted to retrieve information or tamper with internal 	date

Applications and softwares should handle input backend and server-side as apposed to client side.

## Exploits of a Mom

I have came across this comic before in a CS50 course last year. 
It's a joke about how a child was named "DROP TABLE Students;"
This is an SQL query that removes a table called students.
The purpose of this naming, is that when someone enters this students name into the database, they are accidentally injecting SQL code that completely wipes the student information database in one line. It is a lesson as it demonstrates a vulnerability that should be avoided when designing applications and software.

## SQL Zoo
SELECT basics

### 1.
For this, I modified the SQL query where it said 'France' to 'Germany'
**SELECT population FROM world
  WHERE name = 'Germany' **  CORRECT

### 2.
For this, I modified the SQL query where it said 'Brazil', 'Russia', 'India', 'China' to
'Brazil', 'Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark'. 
**SELECT name, population FROM world
  WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark');**
		

### 3. 
For this, I modified the SQL query where it said "BETWEEN 250000 AND 300000" to ""BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000
**SELECT name, area FROM world
  WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000**

## SELECT from WORLD Tutorial
### 1.
For this, the SQL query was already give and the task was to observe the result

### 2.
For this, the task wants the query to change from showing "population = 64105700" to **"population >= 200000000"**

## Solve Portswigger Labs

I was a bit lost trying to find the answer, so I went through the walkthrough https://youtu.be/alTceRdSxS0 and it made prefect sense
The answer was '+OR+1=1-- 
The single quote was to close the empty string quote '', giving an opening to enter our own SQL code. The following proposes a condition that is always to be true, and the dashes signal that the remaining text will be a comment (ignored by query look up system)
This is entered in the query section of the url.
After submitting, we can see a list of all hidden items on the front page.
