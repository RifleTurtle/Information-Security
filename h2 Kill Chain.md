## x) Read and summarize
-network defence tools focus on risk
-New class of threats "Advanced Persistent threat" represents trained adversaries that frequently engage in attempts to target highly sensitive economic, proprietary, or national security information.
-Advanced tools and techniques are used to bypass most computer network defence mechanisms
-Some network defence mechanism record data and behaviour from threats which makes intrusion harder each time.

## Kill chain:
-systematic process to target and engage an adversary
-Us military defines steps as find, fix, track, target, engage, assess
-Each step depends on another

1. Reconnaissance -identification and research of targets
2. Weaponization - preparing a remote access trojan with an exploit into a payload
3. Delivery - transmission of weapon to target
4. Exploitation - after delivery, exploit triggers intruders' code
5. Installation - installation of remote access trojan
6. Command and Control (C2) - gain access inside target environment
7. Actions on Objectives - intruders take action based on original objectives

 # Define tactic and give an example of a specific tactic.
 
Tactics are the reason behind the usage of a cyber attack technique or sub technique. An example is to spread       malware or steal credentials.
  
# Define technique and sub-technique, and give an example of each.

Techniques are the methods and the actions the adversary uses to accomplish their objective. One example is    phishing.

# Define procedure, and give an example of each.

An implementation an adversary uses to use these techniques and sub-techniques. In terms of phishing, Qr codes are     a common implementation
